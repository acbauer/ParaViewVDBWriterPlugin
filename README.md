# ParaViewVDBWriterPlugin
A ParaView plugin for writing out OpenVDB files

This project is not in active development. The OpenVDB writer has made its way into ParaView master (https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview) and will have continued improvements there. The ParaView 5.10 release, slated for fall of 2021, should have this writer included in it.
